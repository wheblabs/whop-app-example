# Authentication
Source: https://dev.whop.com/api-reference/graphql/authentication

An overview of authentication methods for the Whop API

All calls on Whop are made on behalf of a user, and a company ID if applicable, as followed below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript get-user.ts
  export const whopApi = WhopApi({
    appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY,
    onBehalfOfUserId: "YOUR_USER_OR_AN_AGENT_USER",
    companyId: undefined,
  });

  // fetch another user

  await whopApi.FetchPublicUser({ userId: winningUser });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You are able to make calls on behalf of any user using your app.


# Examples
Source: https://dev.whop.com/api-reference/graphql/examples



Here are some useful queries and their implementations to get you started in Next.JS, Swift, or Python:

### Get messages from a direct message feed

```graphql
query DmsFeedData($feedId: ID!, $postsLimit: Int!) {
  dmsFeedData(feedId: $feedId, postsLimit: $postsLimit) {
    posts {
      content
      user {
        username
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Get current user information

```graphql
query myCurrentUser {
  viewer {
    user {
      id
      username
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

### Send chat message

```graphql
mutation SendMessage($input: SendMessageInput!) {
  sendMessage(input: $input)
}
```

### Create a forum post

```graphql
mutation CreateForumPost($input: CreateForumPostInput!) {
  createForumPost(input: $input) {
    # You can specify return fields here if needed
  }
}
```

### Get whops from discover

```graphql
query DiscoverySearch($query: String!) {
  discoverySearch(query: $query) {
    accessPasses {
      title
      route
      headline
      logo {
        sourceUrl
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Examples

### Python (using requests)

```python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "x-on-behalf-of": "user_123",
    "x-company-id": "biz_123",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Example: Fetching DMs
full_query = """query DmsFeedData($feedId: ID!, $postsLimit: Int!) {
    dmsFeedData(feedId: $feedId, postsLimit: $postsLimit) {
        posts {
            content
            user {
                username
                id
            }
        }
    }
}"""

payload = {
    "query": full_query,
    "variables": {
        "feedId": "your_feed_id",
        "postsLimit": 1
    }
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.whop.com/public-graphql",
    headers=headers,
    json=payload
)
response_json = response.json()
```

### Next.js (using Apollo Client)

```typescript
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, createHttpLink } from "@apollo/client";
import { setContext } from "@apollo/client/link/context";
import { gql } from "@apollo/client";

// Create HTTP link
const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  uri: "https://api.whop.com/public-graphql",
});

// Add auth headers
const authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) => {
  return {
    headers: {
      ...headers,
      authorization: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`,
      "x-on-behalf-of": "user_123",
      "x-company-id": "biz_123",
    },
  };
});

// Create Apollo Client
const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: authLink.concat(httpLink),
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

// Example: Discovery Search
const DISCOVERY_SEARCH = gql`
  query DiscoverySearch($query: String!) {
    discoverySearch(query: $query) {
      accessPasses {
        title
        route
        headline
        logo {
          sourceUrl
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

// Usage
client
  .query({
    query: DISCOVERY_SEARCH,
    variables: { query: "search_term" },
  })
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

### Swift (using Apollo iOS)

```swift
import Apollo

// Configure Apollo Client
let url = URL(string: "https://api.whop.com/public-graphql")!

let store = ApolloStore()
let transport = RequestChainNetworkTransport(
    interceptorProvider: DefaultInterceptorProvider(store: store),
    endpointURL: url,
    additionalHeaders: [
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
        "x-on-behalf-of": "user_123",
        "x-company-id": "biz_123"
    ]
)

let client = ApolloClient(networkTransport: transport, store: store)

// Example: Get Current User
let getCurrentUser = """
query myCurrentUser {
  viewer {
    user {
      id
      username
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
"""

client.fetch(query: getCurrentUser) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let graphQLResult):
        print("Success! Result: \(graphQLResult)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Failure! Error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

These examples demonstrate basic usage of the Whop GraphQL API across different platforms. Remember to replace placeholder values (YOUR\_API\_KEY, user\_123, etc.) with your actual credentials.


# Rate Limits
Source: https://dev.whop.com/api-reference/graphql/rate-limits



## Overview

The Whop GraphQL API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and system stability.

## Current Limits

```http
10 requests per 10 seconds
```

## Query Complexity Limits

In addition to request rate limits, the GraphQL API enforces query complexity limits:

* **Max Complexity**: 1000
* **Max Depth**: 10

These limits help prevent overly complex or deeply nested queries that could impact performance.
If you encounter these errors, you'll need to break your requests into smaller queries.

Learn more about query complexity and depth here: [https://www.howtographql.com/advanced/4-security/](https://www.howtographql.com/advanced/4-security/)

## Handling Rate Limits

If you exceed the rate limit, the API will respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.
When this happens, it's best to wait until the rate limit window resets before making additional requests.

## Best Practices

* Implement exponential backoff for retries
* Cache responses when possible
* Batch GraphQL operations into fewer requests


# Schema
Source: https://dev.whop.com/api-reference/graphql/schema



## Why GraphQL

GraphQL is an API interface (alternative to REST) that allows for rapid development and iterative changes to evolving objects.
Whop has built its core product and internal APIs using GraphQL for years, and is now exposing most of the same functionality
via a publicly accessible version.

## Available endpoints

You can explore all available queries and mutations using our Apollo OS explorer:

üîó [GraphQL Explorer](https://studio.apollographql.com/public/whop-public-gql/variant/current/explorer)

To make a call, you must pass the following headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_APP_API_KEY
x-on-behalf-of: user_1NqS34mOp24
x-company-id: biz_Nq4S34mfp59
Content-Type: application/json
```

| Header           | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Authorization`  | Get from [here](/what-to-build/agentic-businesses#step-1%3A-create-your-app). Must be prefixed with "Bearer". |
| `x-on-behalf-of` | Specifies the User ID of the account you're making requests on behalf of.                                     |
| `x-company-id`   | Specifies the Biz ID to target the business of a user you are calling from.                                   |
| `Content-Type`   | Specifies the format of the request payload as JSON.                                                          |

#### Who can you make requests on behalf of?

Your app can make calls on behalf of users in three ways. Any of these methods grant full access to automating the user's account:

* The User is the original creator of the organization in which your app was created (Ex. your own User ID)
* The User is an Agent User created by the app [here](/what-to-build/agentic-businesses#step-1%3A-create-your-app)
* The User has joined a whop that has installed your app

## API Capabilities

This GraphQL API provides **powerful** access to the entire Whop ecosystem, allowing developers to build sophisticated integrations and applications. Through the API, you can access and manipulate all core Whop functionality, including:

* User management
* Store and product handling
* Messages, forum posts, and live streams

## Development Status

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: This API is still under active development.

While we strive to maintain backward compatibility, some features may be added, modified, or removed

We recommend checking our changelog regularly for updates and announcements about API changes.


# Scopes
Source: https://dev.whop.com/api-reference/graphql/scopes

An overview of authorization scopes for the Whop API

When calling the Whop API on behalf of a user or a company you need to first obtain permissions to do so.

Obtain permission by either:

* **embedded apps** - setting your required scopes in your app's settings in the [Whop dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer/)
* **standalone apps** - using the `scopes` parameter when using [Whop OAuth](/features/oauth-guide)

<Note>
  Once you have obtained permissions you can use your app's API key to make
  calls on behalf of the user or company.
</Note>

## Available scopes

* `read_user`: Read the user's basic details. This scope is required and will be automatically granted when users open embedded apps.


# Building Apps
Source: https://dev.whop.com/building-apps

Learn how to build and structure apps on Whop with experience and discover views

Whop apps are composed of **views** - different pages you build into your app that users interact with. Understanding these views is essential for creating a complete app experience.

## App Views

Your app consists of two main types of views:

### Experience Views

An **experience** is an instance of your app when someone installs it into their Whop. Think of it as a unique deployment of your app for a specific community or business. The **experience view** is what users see when they install your app into their Whop and click into it. This is the core functionality of your app - where users interact with your features and services.

* **Route**: Typically `/experiences/[experienceId]`
* **Access**: Private, gated through the Whop SDK
* **Purpose**: Deliver the main app functionality to authorized users

### Discover Views

The **discover view** is a new public-facing view that helps potential users explore what your app offers. This view showcases your app's capabilities and highlights success stories from other communities.

* **Route**: Public page accessible to anyone
* **Access**: No authentication required
* **Purpose**: Marketing and discovery, showcasing app value and success stories

#### Linking to Whops & Showcasing Success

To further promote your app and earn affiliate fees, consider linking to other Whops that use your app and have seen success. You can do this by adding links on your discover view to the Whop's discover page at `/discover/{accessPassRoute}/`, appending your app's ID as a query parameter: `?app={yourAppId}`. For example:

```
/discover/{accessPassRoute}/?app={yourAppId}
```

This not only helps potential users see real-world examples of your app in action, but also allows you to earn affiliate commissions for any referrals.

> **How to get the access pass route:**
> You can use the [Whop SDK](/sdk/api/experiences/list-access-passes-for-experience) to find the `accessPass_route` by experience ID. This will return the access passes for that experience, including the route you can use for linking.

<Callout type="warning">
  When building discover views, include a **64px margin** on your top-level content to prevent it from being hidden by the iframe header.
</Callout>

## Building Experience Views

Our template projects come preconfigured with Whop authentication logic, so you can guarantee users have proper access and retrieve the appropriate IDs and permissions before performing app logic.

If your app requires storing data in an external database,  can use these IDs to properly scope data to the correct experiences and user IDs:

* **Experience ID**: Scope data to specific app installations
* **User ID**: Associate data with individual users

## Monetization with Discover Views

You can collect affiliate fees by linking out to Whops from your discover page. Simply append the query parameter \`?app={yourAppId} to Whop links to track referrals and earn commissions.

## Testing Your App Locally

To test your app during development:

1. Go to [whop.com](https://whop.com) and install your app
2. Navigate to your app details page
3. Set your local paths and environment variables
4. Then click on your app in the sidebar
5. You should see a dev toggle option in the top right. Click on this set the environment to local to preview your local app as you develop,
6. You can switch between experience and discover views to test both interfaces
7. When you are ready to publish, make sure your app base url is set, and you are good to go.

This allows you to develop and test your app locally while maintaining the full Whop integration experience.

# Embed checkout (Public Beta)
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/checkout-embed

Learn how to embed Whop's checkout flow on your website

Embedded checkout allows you to embed Whop's checkout flow on your own website in two easy steps. This allows you to offer your users a seamless checkout experience without leaving your website.

## React

### Step 1: Install the package

```bash
npm install @whop/react
```

### Step 2: Add the checkout element

```tsx
import { WhopCheckoutEmbed } from "@whop/react/checkout";

export default function Home() {
  return <WhopCheckoutEmbed planId="plan_XXXXXXXXX" />;
}
```

This component will now mount an iframe with the Whop checkout embed. Once the checkout is complete, the user will be redirected to the redirect url you specified in the settings on Whop.

You can configure the redirect url in your [whop's settings](https://whop.com/dashboard/whops/) or in your [company's settings](https://whop.com/dashboard/settings/checkout/) on the dashboard. If both are specified, the redirect url specified in the whop's settings will take precedence.

### Available controls

To get access to the controls of the checkout embed, you can use the `ref` prop.

```tsx
const ref = useCheckoutEmbedControls();

return <WhopCheckoutEmbed ref={ref} planId="plan_XXXXXXXXX" />;
```

#### **`submit`**

To submit checkout programmatically, you can use the `submit` method on the checkout element.

```tsx
ref.current?.submit();
```

### Available properties

#### **`planId`**

**Required** - The plan id you want to checkout.

#### **`theme`**

**Optional** - The theme you want to use for the checkout.

Possible values are `light`, `dark` or `system`.

#### **`sessionId`**

**Optional** - The session id to use for the checkout.

This can be used to attach metadata to a checkout by first creating a session through the API and then passing the session id to the checkout element.

#### **`hidePrice`**

**Optional** - Turn on to hide the price in the embedded checkout form.

Defaults to `false`

#### **`hideTermsAndConditions`**

**Optional** - Set to `true` to hide the terms and conditions in the embedded checkout form.

Defaults to `false`

#### **`skipRedirect`**

**Optional** - Set to `true` to skip the final redirect and keep the top frame loaded.

Defaults to `false`

#### **`onComplete`**

**Optional** - A callback function that will be called when the checkout is complete.

<Note>This option will set `skipRedirect` to `true`</Note>

```tsx
<WhopCheckoutEmbed
  onComplete={(planId, receiptId) => {
    console.log(planId, receiptId);
  }}
  planId="plan_XXXXXXXXX"
/>
```

#### **`utm`**

**Optional** - The UTM parameters to add to the checkout URL.

**Note** - The keys must start with `utm_`

```tsx
<WhopCheckoutEmbed
  planId="plan_XXXXXXXXX"
  utm={{ utm_campaign: "ad_XXXXXXX" }}
/>
```

#### **`fallback`**

**Optional** - The fallback content to show while the checkout is loading.

```tsx
<WhopCheckoutEmbed fallback={<>loading...</>} planId="plan_XXXXXXXXX" />
```

#### **`prefill`**

**Optional** - The prefill options to apply to the checkout embed.

Used to prefill the email in the embedded checkout form.
This setting can be helpful when integrating the embed into a funnel that collects the email prior to payment already.

```tsx
<WhopCheckoutEmbed
  prefill={{ email: "example@domain.com" }}
  planId="plan_XXXXXXXXX"
/>
```

### Full example

```tsx
import { WhopCheckoutEmbed } from "@whop/react/checkout";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <WhopCheckoutEmbed
      fallback={<>loading...</>}
      planId="plan_XXXXXXXXX"
      theme="light"
      hidePrice={false}
      sessionId="ch_XXXXXXXXX"
    />
  );
}
```

## Other websites

### Step 1: Add the script tag

To embed checkout, you need to add the following script tag into the `<head>` of your page:

```md
<script
  async
  defer
  src="https://js.whop.com/static/checkout/loader.js"
></script>
```

### Step 2: Add the checkout element

To create a checkout element, you need to include the following attribute on an element in your page:

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

This will now mount an iframe inside of the element with the plan id you provided. Once the checkout is complete, the user will be redirected to the redirect url you specified in the settings on Whop.

You can configure the redirect url in your [whop's settings](https://whop.com/dashboard/whops/) or in your [company's settings](https://whop.com/dashboard/settings/checkout/) on the dashboard. If both are specified, the redirect url specified in the whop's settings will take precedence.

### Available methods

#### **`submit`**

To submit checkout programmatically, you can use the `submit` method on the checkout element.
First, attach an `id` to the checkout container:

```md
<div id="whop-embedded-checkout" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

Then, you can submit the checkout by calling `wco.submit` with the id:

```js
wco.submit("whop-embedded-checkout");
```

### Available attributes

#### **`data-whop-checkout-plan-id`**

**Required** - The plan id you want to checkout.

> To get your plan id, you need to first create a plan in the **Manage Pricing** section on your whop page.

#### **`data-whop-checkout-theme`**

**Optional** - The theme you want to use for the checkout.

Possible values are `light`, `dark` or `system`.

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-theme="light" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

#### **`data-whop-checkout-theme-accent-color`**

**Optional** - The accent color to apply to the checkout embed

Possible values are

* `tomato`
* `red`
* `ruby`
* `crimson`
* `pink`
* `plum`
* `purple`
* `violet`
* `iris`
* `cyan`
* `teal`
* `jade`
* `green`
* `grass`
* `brown`
* `blue`
* `orange`
* `indigo`
* `sky`
* `mint`
* `yellow`
* `amber`
* `lime`
* `lemon`
* `magenta`
* `gold`
* `bronze`
* `gray`

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-theme-accent-color="green" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

#### **`data-whop-checkout-session`**

**Optional** - The session id to use for the checkout.

This can be used to attach metadata to a checkout by first creating a session through the API and then passing the session id to the checkout element.

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-session="ch_XXXXXXXXX" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

#### **`data-whop-checkout-hide-price`**

**Optional** - Set to `true` to hide the price in the embedded checkout form.

Defaults to `false`

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-hide-price="true" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

#### **`data-whop-checkout-hide-submit-button`**

**Optional** - Set to `true` to hide the submit button in the embedded checkout form.

Defaults to `false`

<Note>
  When using this Option, you will need to [programmatically submit](#submit)
  the checkout form.
</Note>

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-hide-submit-button="true" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

#### **`data-whop-checkout-hide-tos`**

**Optional** - Set to `true` to hide the terms and conditions in the embedded checkout form.

Defaults to `false`

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-hide-tos="true" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

#### **`data-whop-checkout-skip-redirect`**

**Optional** - Set to `true` to skip the final redirect and keep the top frame loaded.

Defaults to `false`

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-skip-redirect="true" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

#### **`data-whop-checkout-on-complete`**

**Optional** - The callback to call when the checkout succeeds

<Note>This option will set `data-whop-checkout-skip-redirect` to `true`</Note>

```html
<script>
  window.onCheckoutComplete = (planId, receiptId) => {
    console.log(planId, receiptId);
  };
</script>

<div
  data-whop-checkout-on-complete="onCheckoutComplete"
  data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"
></div>
```

#### **`data-whop-checkout-on-state-change`**

**Optional** - The callback to call when state of the checkout changes

This can be used when programmatically controlling the submit of the checkout embed.

```html
<script>
  window.onCheckoutStateChange = (state) => {
    console.log(state);
  };
</script>

<div
  data-whop-checkout-on-state-change="onCheckoutStateChange"
  data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"
></div>
```

#### **`data-whop-checkout-skip-utm`**

By default any utm params from the main page will be forwarded to the checkout embed.

**Optional** - Set to `true` to prevent the automatic forwarding of utm parameters

Defaults to `false`

#### **`data-whop-checkout-prefill-email`**

Used to prefill the email in the embedded checkout form. This setting can be helpful when integrating the embed into a funnel that collects the email prior to payment already.

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-prefill-email="example@domain.com" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

# Login with Whop
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/oauth-guide

Learn how to implement Whop OAuth in a stand-alone application.

## Intro

Use Whop OAuth to authenticate users in your web or iOS app.

<Note>
  This guide only covers the basic steps to implement Whop OAuth and does not cover best practices regarding the OAuth2 protocol. It is recommended to use a library to handle the OAuth2 flow.

  We are going to release a guide on how to implement Whop OAuth with auth.js soon.
</Note>

### Step 1: Create a Whop App and obtain secrets

1. Go to the [Whop Dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer/) and create a new app or select an existing one.

2. Add a redirect uri in your apps OAuth settings

   To test your app locally you can add a redirect uri on `http://localhost:{PORT}` but it is recommended to use https for production.

3. Copy the app id and api key and set them in your environment variables.

   Keep in mind that the api key is a secret and should not be shared with anyone. The app id is public and can be shared with anyone.

   ```.env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=your-app-id
   WHOP_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

### Step 2: Initiate the OAuth flow

#### Setup the OAuth flow

To follow this guide you will need to install the `@whop/api` package from npm:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm i @whop/api
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm i @whop/api
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add @whop/api
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Start off by creating a route that will be hit by the user when they click the `Login with Whop` button:

```ts /api/oauth/init/route.ts
import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

const whopApi = WhopServerSdk({
  appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY!,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID,
});

export function GET(request: Request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const next = url.searchParams.get("next") ?? "/home";

  const { url, state } = whopApi.oauth.getAuthorizationUrl({
    // This has to be defined in the redirect uris outlined in step 1.2
    redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000/api/oauth/callback",
    // These are the authorization scopes you want to request from the user.
    scope: ["read_user"],
  });

  // The state is used to restore the `next` parameter after the user lands on the callback route.
  // Note: This is not a secure way to store the state and for demonstration purposes only.
  return Response.redirect(url, {
    headers: {
      "Set-Cookie": `oauth-state.${state}=${encodeURIComponent(
        next
      )}; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=3600`,
    },
  });
}
```

<Note>
  Read more about available scopes [here](/api-reference/graphql/scopes).
</Note>

#### Adding the `Login with Whop` button

Now continue by adding a link to your app that will initiate the `Login with Whop` flow:

```html
<a href="/api/oauth/init?next=/home">Login with Whop</a>
```

Upon clicking the link the user will be redirected to the Whop OAuth page and is prompted to authorize your app.

### Step 3: Exchange the code for a token

Upon successful authorization the user will be redirected to the redirect uri you specified in the query parameters with `code` and `state` query parameters:

```ts /api/oauth/callback/route.ts
import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

const whopApi = WhopServerSdk({
  appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY!,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID,
});

export function GET(request: Request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const code = url.searchParams.get("code");
  const state = url.searchParams.get("state");

  if (!code) {
    // redirect to error page
    return Response.redirect("/oauth/error?error=missing_code");
  }

  if (!state) {
    // redirect to error page
    return Response.redirect("/oauth/error?error=missing_state");
  }

  const stateCookie = request.headers
    .get("Cookie")
    ?.split(";")
    .find((cookie) => cookie.trim().startsWith(`oauth-state.${state}=`));

  if (!stateCookie) {
    // redirect to error page
    return Response.redirect("/oauth/error?error=invalid_state");
  }

  // exchange the code for a token
  const authResponse = await whopApi.oauth.exchangeCode({
    code,
    redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000/api/oauth/callback",
  });

  if (!authResponse.ok) {
    return Response.redirect("/oauth/error?error=code_exchange_failed");
  }

  const { access_token } = authResponse.tokens;

  // Restore the `next` parameter from the state cookie set in the previous step.
  const next = decodeURIComponent(stateCookie.split("=")[1]);
  const nextUrl = new URL(next, "http://localhost:3000");

  // This is an example, you should not store the plain user auth token in a cookie in production.

  // After setting the cookie you can now identify the user by reading the cookie when the user visits your website.
  return Response.redirect(nextUrl.toString(), {
    headers: {
      "Set-Cookie": `whop_access_token=${access_token}; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=3600`,
    },
  });
}
```

## Implementing with authentication frameworks

### Auth.js

To implement Whop OAuth with auth.js you can use the `authJsProvider` method on the `WhopOAuth` class.

Get started by setting up the relevant auth.js distribution:

* Next.js ([Installation Guide](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation?framework=Next.js)) via `next-auth@beta`
* SvelteKit ([Installation Guide](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation?framework=SvelteKit)) via `@auth/sveltekit`
* Qwik ([Installation Guide](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation?framework=Qwik)) via `@auth/qwik`
* Express ([Installation Guide](https://authjs.dev/getting-started/installation?framework=Express)) via `@auth/express`

Create a Whop OAuth provider and add it to your auth.js provider configuration:

```ts
const WhopProvider = whopApi.oauth.authJsProvider({
  scope: ["read_user"],
});

const authConfig = {
  providers: [WhopProvider],
  // ... rest of your auth.js configuration
};
```


# Payments and payouts
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/payments-and-payouts

Use the API to collect payment from users or payout users.

## Collecting Payments

First, create the charge on the server using the Whop API. Then you can either:

1. Open a modal in your app using the iframe SDK (recommended)
2. Redirect the user to Whop's checkout page

### 1. Create the charge on the server

> This step will create a charge on the server and return the inAppPurchase object required for the next step.

On the server, use the [chargeUser](/sdk/api/payments/charge-user) method to create a charge:

```typescript app/api/charge/route.ts
import { whopSdk } from "@/lib/whop-sdk";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const { userId, experienceId } = await request.json();

    const result = await whopSdk.payments.chargeUser({
      amount: 100,
      currency: "usd",
      userId: userId,
      // metadata is information that you'd like to receive later about the payment.
      metadata: {
        creditsToPurchase: 1,
        experienceId: experienceId,
      },
    });

    if (!result?.inAppPurchase) {
      throw new Error("Failed to create charge");
    }

    return Response.json(result.inAppPurchase);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating charge:", error);
    return Response.json({ error: "Failed to create charge" }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### 2. Confirm the payment on the client

> In this step the user will be prompted to confirm the previously created charge in a modal.

<Warning>
  This function requires the iFrame SDK to be initialized. See [**iFrame
  Overview**](/sdk/iframe-setup) for more information.
</Warning>

Use the iframe SDK to open a payment modal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```tsx React
  "use client";
  import { useIframeSdk } from "@whop/react";

  export default function PaymentButton({
    userId,
    experienceId,
  }: {
    userId: string;
    experienceId: string;
  }) {
    const iframeSdk = useIframeSdk();
    
    const [receiptId, setReceiptId] = useState<string>();
    const [error, setError] = useState<string>();
    
    async function handlePurchase() {
      try {
        // 1. Create charge on server
        const response = await fetch("/api/charge", {
          method: "POST",
          body: JSON.stringify({ userId, experienceId }),
        });
        
        if (response.ok) {
          const inAppPurchase = await response.json();
          // 2. Open payment modal
          const res = await iframeSdk.inAppPurchase(inAppPurchase);
          
          if (res.status === "ok") {
            setReceiptId(res.data.receipt_id);
            setError(undefined);
          } else {
            setReceiptId(undefined);
            setError(res.error);
          }
        } else {
          throw new Error("Failed to create charge");
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Purchase failed:", error);
        setError("Purchase failed");
      }
    }
    
    return <button onClick={handlePurchase}>Purchase Plan</button>;
  }
  ```

  ```tsx Vanilla JS
  import { iframeSdk } from "@/lib/iframe-sdk";

  const paymentButton = document.querySelector("button#payment-button");
  const receiptElement = document.querySelector("span#receiptContainer");
  const errorElement = document.querySelector("span#errorContainer");

  function setError(error?: string) {
    if (errorElement instanceof HTMLSpanElement) {
      errorElement.textContent = error ?? "";
    }
  }

  function setReceiptId(receiptId?: string) {
    if (receiptElement instanceof HTMLSpanElement) {
      receiptElement.textContent = receiptId ?? "";
    }
  }

  if (paymentButton instanceof HTMLButtonElement) {
    paymentButton.addEventListener(
      "click",
      async function onPaymentButtonClick() {
        const userId = this.dataset.userId;
        const experienceId = this.dataset.experienceId;
        if (!userId || !experienceId) {
          throw new Error("Missing userId or experienceId");
        }

        try {
          // 1. Create charge on server
          const response = await fetch("/api/charge", {
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify({ userId, experienceId }),
          });

          if (response.ok) {
            const inAppPurchase = await response.json();
            // 2. Open payment modal
            const res = await iframeSdk.inAppPurchase(inAppPurchase);

            if (res.status === "ok") {
              setReceiptId(res.data.receipt_id);
              setError(undefined);
            } else {
              setReceiptId(undefined);
              setError(res.error);
            }
          } else {
            throw new Error("Failed to create charge");
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Purchase failed:", error);
          setError("Purchase failed");
        }
      }
    );
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Sending Payouts

You can send payouts to any user using their Whop username. The funds will be transferred from your company's ledger account.

### Transfer Funds

```typescript
import { whopSdk } from "@/lib/whop-sdk";

async function sendPayout(
  companyId: string,
  recipientUsername: string,
  amount: number
) {
  // 1. Get your company's ledger account
  const experience = await whopSdk.experiences.getExperience({ experienceId });
  const companyId = experience.company.id;
  const ledgerAccount = await whopSdk.companies.getCompanyLedgerAccount({
    companyId,
  });

  // 2. Pay the recipient
  await whopSdk.payments.payUser({
    amount: amount,
    currency: "usd",
    // Username or ID or ledger account ID of the recipient user
    destinationId: recipientUsername,
    // Your company's ledger account ID that can be retrieve from whopSdk.companies.getCompanyLedgerAccount()
    ledgerAccountId: ledgerAccount.company?.ledgerAccount.id!,
    // Optional transfer fee in percentage
    transferFee: ledgerAccount.company?.ledgerAccount.transferFee,
  });
}
```


# Create forum post
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/post-to-feed

Create a forum and a post using the API

## Overview

To post in a forum, you must:

1. Find or create a *Forum Experience*
2. Create a *Forum Post* inside the *Forum Experience*

<Info>
  If you already know what forum experience you want to post in, you can skip
  step 1, and use the experience ID directly in step 2.
</Info>

***

## Find or create a forum experience

A forum post must be created within a **Forum Experience**.
The `findOrCreateForum` method will find an existing forum experience with the specified name,
or create a new one with all the specified options

```typescript
const newForum = await whopSdk
  .withUser("YOUR_AGENT_USER_ID")
  .forums.findOrCreateForum({
    experienceId: experienceId,
    name: "Dino game results",
    whoCanPost: "admins",
    // optional:
    // expiresAt: Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
    // price: {
    // baseCurrency: "usd",
    // initialPrice: 100,
    // }
  });
```

> This will create the forum in the same whop as the supplied experience.

***

## Create a forum post.

Once you have the `experienceId` from the above, use it to create a post.

### Basic Forum Post

```ts
const forumPost = await whopSdk
  .withUser("YOUR_AGENT_USER_ID")
  .forums.createForumPost({
    forumExperienceId: newForum.createForum?.id,
    title: "Welcome!",
    content: "Excited to kick things off in our new forum üéâ",
  });
```

* `withUser()`: ID of the user posting
* `forumExperienceId`: The ID of the target forum
* `title` and `content`: Main post body. *(title is optional)*

### Forum post with advanced options

This demonstrates a rich post using all features:

```ts
const forumPost = await whopSdk
  .withUser("YOUR_AGENT_USER_ID")
  .forums.createForumPost({
    forumExperienceId: "exp_XXXXXX",
    // Visible even before purchase.
    title: "Big Launch + Community Poll!",
    // Visible only after purchase
    content: "Hidden content unless purchased. üîí",
    // Add media to the post.
    // Learn how to upload in the upload-media section
    attachments: [
      {
        directUploadId: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
      },
    ],

    // Do not send a notification to everyone about this post.
    isMention: false,

    // Lock the content and attachments behind a
    // one time purchase in the price + currency.
    paywallAmount: 9.99,
    paywallCurrency: "usd",

    // Add a poll to the post.
    poll: {
      options: [
        { id: "1", text: "New Product Features" },
        { id: "2", text: "Exclusive AMA" },
        { id: "3", text: "Member Giveaways" },
      ],
    },
  });
```


# Send push notification
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/send-push-notification

Send a push notification to a user or a group of users.

## Send a notification to everyone in an experience.

<Info>
  Make sure you have [setup your whop SDK client on the
  server](/sdk/whop-api-client)
</Info>

```typescript
import { whopSdk } from "@/lib/whop-sdk";

// This could be a server action / api route that create a
// piece of content in your app for this experience
export async function createSomeContentInExperience(
  experienceId: string,
  content: string, // this could be a more complex type depending on your specific app.
  createdByUserId: string
) {
  // Create the content in your app.
  // ... await some database call etc etc...

  // Send a push notification to everyone in the experience.
  await whopSdk.notifications.sendPushNotification({
    title: "New content is available" /* Required! */,
    content: content.slice(0, 100) + "...", // Format the content as you wish.
    experienceId, // send to all users with access to this experience.

    isMention: false, // Set this to true to make everyone immediately
    // get a mobile push notification.

    senderUserId: createdByUserId, // This will render this user's
    // profile picture as the notification image.
  });
}
```

See the full list of accepted parameters [here](/sdk/api/notifications/send-push-notification).

## Adding a deeplink to the notification.

When you send a notification, you will usually want to send the user to specific section in your app upon clicking the notification.
You can do this by using the `restPath` property.

1. Update your app path in the dashboard to handle the additional parameters.

   In the hosting section, set the "App path" field to something like: `/experiences/[experienceId]/[restPath]`

2. In your `sendPushNotification` call, add the `restPath` property.

   ```typescript
   await whopSdk.notifications.sendPushNotification({
     title: "New content is available",
     content: content.slice(0, 100) + "...",
     experienceId,
     restPath: `/posts/${somePostId}`, // The specific posts route is just an example
     // You could also just add a query param like this:
     // restPath: `?id=${specialId}`,
   });
   ```

3. Update you app to handle the following route:

   When clicking on a notification, the user will open this specific url on your app within the whop iframe.

   ```
   https://your-domain.com/experiences/exp_123/posts/post_123
   ```

   If using NextJS, you can add a `page.tsx` file with the path: `app/experiences/[experienceId]/posts/[postId]/page.tsx`

   <Info>
     Note: the exact path will depend on the pathname structure you set in the
     `restPath` property.
   </Info>

## Sending a notification to company admins

Your app may want to alert company admins only, not all members. Use the `companyTeamId` field instead of the `experienceId` when sending the notification.

```typescript
await whopSdk.notifications.sendPushNotification({
  title: "A member just posted a new listing. Review it now.",
  content: `${listingTitle}`,
  companyTeamId,
});
```

<Info>
  You must send either the `companyTeamId` or the `experienceId` when sending a
  notification. Setting both will result in an error.
</Info>

## Sending a notification to a specific subset of users.

Use the `userIds` field to filter the users who will receive the notification.

Whop will first apply either the `experienceId` or the `companyTeamId` filter and then apply the `userIds` filter

Ensure that the `userIds` array contains valid user IDs that are part of the specified experience or company team.

For example if you a building a bidding app you may want to alert the highest bidder if they were just outbid.

```typescript
await whopSdk.notifications.sendPushNotification({
  title: "You were just outbid",
  content: `${listingTitle}`,
  experienceId, // the experience ID that the current item is listed within.
  userIds: [oldHighestBidderUserId],
});
```


# Subscriptions
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/subscriptions

Gate your app behind a subscription or one-time purchase

## Setup your access pass on the dashboard.

1. Go to the your [app's dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer).
2. Select the access passes tab and create an access pass. Give it a name like "My App Premium"
3. Create a pricing plan for the access pass by clicking the "Add Pricing" button from the table row.
4. After creating the pricing plan, copy the plan id from the 3 dot menu in the pricing plan card.
5. Also copy the access pass id from the 3 dot menu in the access pass table row.

<Info>
  We recommend storing the access pass id and plan id in environment variables
  for your app. Eg:

  ```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_ACCESS_PASS_ID="prod_XXXXXXXX"
  NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_PLAN_ID="plan_XXXXXXXX"
  ```
</Info>

## Check if users have access

When a user makes a request to your app, you can easily check if they have access using the whop api.

```typescript
const hasAccess = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToAccessPass({
  accessPassId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_ACCESS_PASS_ID, // from step 5 above.
  userId: userId,
});
```

If a user does not have access, you can [prompt them to purchase](#collect-payment-from-users) or show a lite "free" version of the app to upsell them.

## Collect payment from users

<Warning>
  This function requires the iFrame SDK to be initialized. See [**iFrame
  Overview**](/sdk/iframe-setup) for more information.
</Warning>

Use the iframe sdk to collect payment from users. This will show a whop native payment modal in which the user can confirm their purchase.

<CodeGroup>
  ```tsx React
  "use client";
  import { useIframeSdk } from "@whop/react";

  export default function GetAccessButton() {
    const iframeSdk = useIframeSdk();
    
    const [receiptId, setReceiptId] = useState<string>();
    const [error, setError] = useState<string>();
    
    async function handlePurchase() {
      try {
  		const res = await iframeSdk.inAppPurchase({ planId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_PLAN_ID });
  		
  		if (res.status === "ok") {
  			setReceiptId(res.data.receipt_id);
  			setError(undefined);
  		} else {
  			setReceiptId(undefined);
  			setError(res.error);
  		}
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Purchase failed:", error);
        setError("Purchase failed");
      }
    }
    
    return <button onClick={handlePurchase}>Get Access</button>;
  }
  ```

  ```tsx Vanilla JS
  import { iframeSdk } from "@/lib/iframe-sdk";

  const getAccessButton = document.querySelector("button#get-access-button");
  const receiptElement = document.querySelector("span#receiptContainer");
  const errorElement = document.querySelector("span#errorContainer");

  function setError(error?: string) {
    if (errorElement instanceof HTMLSpanElement) {
      errorElement.textContent = error ?? "";
    }
  }

  function setReceiptId(receiptId?: string) {
    if (receiptElement instanceof HTMLSpanElement) {
      receiptElement.textContent = receiptId ?? "";
    }
  }

  if (getAccessButton instanceof HTMLButtonElement) {
    getAccessButton.addEventListener(
      "click",
      async function onGetAccessButtonClick() {
        try {
          const res = await iframeSdk.inAppPurchase({
            planId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_PLAN_ID,
          });

          if (res.status === "ok") {
            setReceiptId(res.data.receipt_id);
            setError(undefined);
          } else {
            setReceiptId(undefined);
            setError(res.error);
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Purchase failed:", error);
          setError("Purchase failed");
        }
      }
    );
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# Attaching custom metadata to a subscription

You can attach custom metadata to a subscription by using the `createCheckoutSession` mutation.

For example, you can use this to associate a subscription with an experience or company that it was created for.
Using this you can attribute the source of the subscription and build powerful revenue sharing features into your app.

Before using the `iframeSdk.inAppPurchase` function, you need to create a checkout session, and pass it to the function.

### Create the checkout session in a server action.

Use the whopSdk to create a checkout session on your backend, pass the experienceId to this function.

```typescript
import { whopSdk } from "@/lib/whop-sdk";
import { headers } from "next/headers";

export async function createSubscription(experienceId: string) {
  const { userId } = await whopSdk.verifyUserToken(await headers());

  // Check to make sure the current user has access to the experience.
  const hasAccess = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({
    userId,
    experienceId,
  });

  const checkoutSession = await whopSdk.payments.createCheckoutSession({
    planId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_PLAN_ID,
    metadata: {
      experienceId,
    },
  });

  return checkoutSession;
}
```

### Pass the checkout session to the iframeSdk.inAppPurchase function.

```tsx React
"use client";

import { useIframeSdk } from "@whop/react";
import { createSubscription } from "@/lib/actions/create-subscription";

export default function GetAccessButton({
  experienceId,
}: {
  experienceId: string;
}) {
  const iframeSdk = useIframeSdk();

  const [receiptId, setReceiptId] = useState<string>();
  const [error, setError] = useState<string>();

  async function handlePurchase() {
    try {
      const inAppPurchase = await createSubscription(experienceId);
      const res = await iframeSdk.inAppPurchase(inAppPurchase);

      if (res.status === "ok") {
        setReceiptId(res.data.receipt_id);
        setError(undefined);
      } else {
        setReceiptId(undefined);
        setError(res.error);
      }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Purchase failed:", error);
      setError("Purchase failed");
    }
  }

  return <button onClick={handlePurchase}>Get Access</button>;
}
```

This custom metadata will be available in the webhook payloads sent to your server (if enabled).

You can use the `payUser` mutation to share your subscription revenue with the creator of the experience.


# Upload media
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/upload-media

Use Whop to upload images, videos, audio, and other files.

### Client-Side: Set up the Image Upload Component

First, create a component to handle image uploads. This example uses `react-dropzone` for the file upload interface.

```typescript
import { useState, useCallback, useEffect } from "react";
import { useDropzone } from "react-dropzone";

function ImageUploader() {
  // Set up state for the image file and preview
  const [image, setImage] = useState<{
    file: File;
    preview: string;
  } | null>(null);

  // Clean up object URLs when component unmounts
  useEffect(() => {
    const objectUrl = image?.preview;
    if (objectUrl) {
      return () => {
        URL.revokeObjectURL(objectUrl);
      };
    }
  }, [image?.preview]);

  // Handle file drops
  const onDrop = useCallback((acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
    const file = acceptedFiles[0];
    if (file) {
      setImage({
        file,
        preview: URL.createObjectURL(file),
      });
    }
  }, []);

  // Configure dropzone
  const { getRootProps, getInputProps, isDragActive } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
    accept: {
      "image/*": [".jpeg", ".jpg", ".png", ".gif"],
    },
    maxFiles: 1,
  });

  return (
    <div {...getRootProps()} className="border-2 border-dashed rounded-lg p-8">
      <input {...getInputProps()} />
      {image?.preview ? (
        <img src={image.preview} alt="Preview" className="max-w-full h-auto" />
      ) : (
        <p>Drag & drop an image here, or click to select</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Server-Side: Handle File Uploads

Create an API route to handle the file upload using the Whop SDK:

```typescript
import { whopSdk } from "@/lib/whop-sdk";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    // Verify user authentication
    const headersList = await headers();
    const userToken = await whopSdk.verifyUserToken(headersList);
    if (!userToken) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
    }

    // Get the file from the request
    const file = await request.blob();

    // Upload to Whop
    const response = await whopSdk.attachments.uploadAttachment({
      file: new File([file], `upload-${Date.now()}.png`, {
        type: "image/png",
      }),
      record: "forum_post", // or other record types
    });

    // The response includes the directUploadId and URL
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      attachmentId: response.directUploadId,
      url: response.attachment.source.url,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error uploading file:", error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Failed to upload file" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

### Using Uploaded Media

After uploading, you can use the attachment ID in various Whop features. For example, to create a forum post with the uploaded image (server-side):

```typescript
const createForumPost = async (attachmentId: string) => {
  const post = await whopSdk.forums.createForumPost({
    forumExperienceId: "your-forum-id",
    content: "Check out this image!",
    attachments: [{ directUploadId: attachmentId }],
  });

  return post;
};
```

### Supported File Types

The Whop API supports the following file types for upload:

* Images: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`
* Videos: `.mp4`, `.mov`
* Documents: `.pdf`

### Best Practices

1. **File Size**: Keep uploads under 100MB for optimal performance
2. **Image Optimization**: Consider using libraries like `sharp` for image processing before upload
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling on both client and server
4. **Clean Up**: Remember to clean up any preview URLs to prevent memory leaks
5. **Security**: Always verify user authentication before handling uploads
6. **Progress Tracking**: Consider implementing upload progress tracking for better UX

### Complete Example

Here's a complete example showing both client and server integration:

```typescript
// app/components/MediaUploader.tsx (Client)
import { useState, useCallback, useEffect } from "react";
import { useDropzone } from "react-dropzone";

export default function MediaUploader() {
  const [image, setImage] = useState<{
    file: File;
    preview: string;
  } | null>(null);
  const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      if (image?.preview) {
        URL.revokeObjectURL(image.preview);
      }
    };
  }, [image]);

  const onDrop = useCallback((acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
    const file = acceptedFiles[0];
    if (file) {
      setImage({
        file,
        preview: URL.createObjectURL(file),
      });
    }
  }, []);

  const { getRootProps, getInputProps } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
    accept: {
      "image/*": [".jpeg", ".jpg", ".png", ".gif"],
    },
    maxFiles: 1,
  });

  const handleUpload = async () => {
    if (!image?.file) return;

    setIsUploading(true);
    try {
      // Send to your API route
      const formData = new FormData();
      formData.append("file", image.file);

      const response = await fetch("/api/upload", {
        method: "POST",
        body: formData,
      });

      const data = await response.json();

      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(data.error);
      }

      // Clear the form after successful upload
      setImage(null);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Upload failed:", error);
    } finally {
      setIsUploading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <div
        {...getRootProps()}
        className="border-2 border-dashed rounded-lg p-8"
      >
        <input {...getInputProps()} />
        {image?.preview ? (
          <img
            src={image.preview}
            alt="Preview"
            className="max-w-full h-auto"
          />
        ) : (
          <p>Drag & drop an image here, or click to select</p>
        )}
      </div>

      {image && (
        <button
          onClick={handleUpload}
          disabled={isUploading}
          className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
        >
          {isUploading ? "Uploading..." : "Upload"}
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Connect to websocket
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/websocket-guide

Learn how to implement real-time features using Whop's websocket API

You can connect to the websocket from your client side frontend code running in the iFrame.

## Client Setup

### React

When using react, it is recommended to use the `WhopWebsocketProvider` provider from the `@whop/react` package to connect to the websocket.

1. Mount the `WhopWebsocketProvider` provider:

   ```tsx app/layout.tsx
   import { WhopWebsocketProvider } from "@whop/react";
   import { handleAppMessage } from "@/lib/handle-websocket-message";

   export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
     return (
       <WhopWebsocketProvider
         // optional, you can join a specific experience channel (ie, the one you are currently viewing).
         joinExperience="exp_XXXX"
         // optional, you can join a custom channel.
         joinCustom="some_custom_channel"
         // optional, a callback that is called when an app message is received. you can also use the `useOnWebsocketMessage` hook to handle messages.
         onAppMessage={handleAppMessage}
       >
         {children}
       </WhopWebsocketProvider>
     );
   }
   ```

2. Handle app messages:

   ```tsx lib/handle-websocket-message.tsx
   export function handleAppMessage(message: proto.common.AppMessage) {
     console.log("Received app message:", message);

     // message.isTrusted is true if and only if the message was sent from your server with your private app API key.

     // message.json is the JSON string you sent from your server / client.

     // if you sent the message from the client using websocket.broadcast,
     // message.fromUserId will include the user id of the user who sent the message.
   }

   // You can also handle messages using the `useOnWebsocketMessage` hook.
   export function MyNestedReactComponent() {
     const [state, setState] = useState<string>("");
     useOnWebsocketMessage((message) => {
       setState(message.json);
     });
     return <div>{state}</div>;
   }
   ```

3. Handle connection status changes:

   ```tsx
   import { useWebsocketStatus } from "@whop/react";

   // inside of a component
   const connectionStatus = useWebsocketStatus();
   ```

### Other frameworks

Alternatively, you can create the websocket client using the `@whop/api` package in any framework.

1. Create the websocket client:

   ```typescript
   import { WhopClientSdk } from "@whop/api";

   const whopApi = WhopClientSdk();

   const websocket = whopApi.websocketClient({
     joinExperience: "exp_XXXX", // optional, you can join a specific experience channel (ie, the one you are currently viewing).
     joinCustom: "some_custom_channel", // optional, you can join a custom channel.
   });
   ```

2. Add event handlers for messages:

   ```typescript
   websocket.on("appMessage", (message) => {
     console.log("Received custom message:", message);

     // message.isTrusted is true if and only if the message was sent from your server with your private app API key.

     // message.json is the JSON string you sent from your server / client.

     // if you sent the message from the client using websocket.broadcast,
     // message.fromUserId will include the user id of the user who sent the message.
   });
   ```

3. Handle connection status changes:

   ```typescript
   websocket.on("connectionStatus", (status) => {
     console.log("Websocket Status Updated:", status);
   });

   websocket.on("connect", () => {
     console.log("Websocket Connected");
   });

   websocket.on("disconnect", () => {
     console.log("Websocket Disconnected");
   });
   ```

4. Connect to the websocket and start receiving events:

   ```typescript
   websocket.connect();
   ```

5. *Optional:* Disconnect from the websocket:

   ```typescript
   websocket.disconnect();
   ```

## Send messages from the client

You can send messages from the client to the server by using the `websocket.broadcast` or `useBroadcastWebsocketMessage` function.

1. Create a websocket client as above.

2. Send a custom message via websocket.

<CodeGroup>
  ```tsx React
  import { useBroadcastWebsocketMessage } from "@whop/react";

  export function SendMessageExample() {
    const broadcast = useBroadcastWebsocketMessage();

    function sendMessage () {
       broadcast({
          message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
          target: "everyone",
       });
    }

    return <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send Message</button>
  }

  ```

  ```typescript Other frameworks
  // make sure you are connected by calling `websocket.connect()`

  websocket.broadcast({
    message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
    target: "everyone",
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The target field is the same as the one you would pass to
  `whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage` on the server.
</Note>

## Send messages from your server

You can broadcast trusted websocket messages from your server to connected clients by using the `whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage` function.

1. Construct an instance of the whop server sdk and pass your API key:

   ```typescript
   import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

   const whopApi = WhopServerSdk({
     appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY,
   });
   ```

2. Send a custom string message via websocket.

   ```typescript
   // Send to all users currently on your app across all experiences / views.
   whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
     message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
     target: "everyone",
   });

   // send to all users currently on this experience
   // (only works if the experience belongs to your app)
   whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
     message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
     target: { experience: "exp_XXXX" },
   });

   // create a custom channel that your websocket client can subscribe to.
   // Only works if when connecting on the client, you pass the same custom channel name.
   whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
     message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
     target: { custom: "some_custom_channel" },
   });

   // send to a specific user on your app
   whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
     message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
     target: { user: "user_XXXX" },
   });
   ```

## Receive messages on your server

<Info>
  Before you start, make sure you are using NodeJS 22.4 or higher, or Bun to run
  your server.
</Info>

Use the server websocket API to receive events such as chat messages as forum posts for a particular user on your server.
You can use these events to build real-time apps such as chat bots and AI-agents that react to events on the platform.

1. Construct (or reuse) an instance of the whop server sdk and pass your API key:

   ```typescript
   import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

   const whopApi = WhopServerSdk({
     appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY,
   });
   ```

2. Create your websocket client and add handlers for messages / status changes:

   ```typescript
   const websocket = whopApi
     // Pass the user id of the user you want to receive events for
     .withUser("user_v9KUoZvTGp6ID")
     // Construct the websocket client
     .websocketClient();
   ```

3. Add event handlers for messages:

   ```typescript
   websocket.on("message", (message) => {
     console.log("Received Message:", message);

     const chatMessage = message.feedEntity?.dmsPost;
     if (chatMessage) {
       // handle the chat message
     }

     const forumPost = message.feedEntity?.forumPost;
     if (forumPost) {
       // handle the forum post
     }
   });
   ```

4. Add event handlers for status changes (same as client API):

   ```typescript
   websocket.on("connectionStatus", (status) => {
     console.log("Websocket Status Updated:", status);
   });

   // Or you can also listen to the connect and disconnect events:
   websocket.on("connect", () => {
     console.log("Websocket Connected");
   });

   websocket.on("disconnect", () => {
     console.log("Websocket Disconnected");
   });
   ```

5. Connect to the websocket and start receiving events:

   ```typescript
   websocket.connect();
   ```

6. *Optional:* Disconnect from the websocket:

   ```typescript
   websocket.disconnect();
   ```

# Open External Links
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/external-url

Open external links from within the iFrame

If you want to open external links from within the iFrame, you can use the `openExternalLinks` function. This will close your app and move to a new website.

## Usage

<Warning>
  This function requires the iFrame SDK to be initialized. See [**iFrame
  Overview**](/sdk/iframe-setup) for more information.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript React
  "use client";
  import { useIframeSdk } from "@whop/react";

  export default function Home() {
  	const iframeSdk = useIframeSdk();
  	
  	function openLink() {
  		iframeSdk.openExternalUrl({ url: "https://google.com" });
  	}
  	
  	return <button onClick={openLink}>Click me to open Google</button>;
  }
  ```

  ```javascript Vanilla JS
  import { iframeSdk } from "@/lib/iframe-sdk";

  const navigationButtonElement = document.querySelector("button");

  if (navigationButtonElement) {
    navigationButtonElement.addEventListener("click", () => {
      iframeSdk.openExternalUrl({ url: "https://google.com" });
    });
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## User Profiles

If you want to display a whop user profile, you can use the `openExternalUrl` method
and pass their profile page link which looks like `https://whop.com/@username`.

The whop app will intercept this and instead display a modal containing their user profile.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript React
  "use client";
  import { useIframeSdk } from "@whop/react";

  export default function Home() {
  	const iframeSdk = useIframeSdk();
  	
  	function openLink() {
  		iframeSdk.openExternalUrl({ url: "https://whop.com/@j" });
  	}
  	
  	return <button onClick={openLink}>Click me to open Google</button>;
  }
  ```

  ```javascript Vanilla JS
  import { iframeSdk } from "@/lib/iframe-sdk";

  const navigationButtonElement = document.querySelector("button");

  if (navigationButtonElement) {
    navigationButtonElement.addEventListener("click", () => {
      iframeSdk.openExternalUrl({ url: "https://whop.com/@j" });
    });
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  You can also use a user ID instead of username. The final link should look
  like this: `https://whop.com/@user_XXXXXXXX`
</Info>


# Getting Started
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/iframe-setup

Getting started with the Whop iFrame SDK

Whop apps are embedded into the site using iFrames. This SDK provides a type-safe way for you to communicate with the Whop application using a request/response style API powered by `window.postMessage`.

Since this package relies on `window.postMessage`, it only works in **Client Components**.

### Relevant Packages

* `@whop/iframe` - The main package for the iframe SDK.
* `@whop/react` - A React wrapper for Whop Apps including helpers for the iframe SDK.

***

## Setup

The main function exported from the `@whop/iframe` package is the `createSdk` function. When called, this function sets up a listener for messages from the main Whop site, using `window.on('message', ...)`. It is also exposed through the `WhopIframeSdkProvider` component from `@whop/react`.

### React

If you're using React, it is recommended to use the `WhopIframeSdkProvider` component from `@whop/react` to provide the iframe SDK to all child components.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Step 1: Mount provider in root layout
  // app/layout.tsx
  import { WhopIframeSdkProvider } from "@whop/react";

  export default function RootLayout({
    children,
  }: {
    children: React.ReactNode,
  }) {
    return (
      <html lang="en">
        <body>
          <WhopIframeSdkProvider>{children}</WhopIframeSdkProvider>
        </body>
      </html>
    );
  }
  ```

  ```javascript Step 2: Consume the iframe SDK in a component
  // components/example.tsx
  import { useIframeSdk } from "@whop/react";

  export const Example = () => {
    const iframeSdk = useIframeSdk();

    return (
      <button
        onClick={() => iframeSdk.openExternalUrl({ url: "https://example.com" })}
      >
        Open External URL
      </button>
    );
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Other Frameworks

For other frameworks, you can use the `createSdk` function from `@whop/iframe` to create an instance of the iframe SDK.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Step 1: Create the iframe SDK instance
  // lib/iframe-sdk.ts
  import { createSdk } from "@whop/iframe";

  export const iframeSdk = createSdk({
    appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID,
  });
  ```

  ```javascript Step 2: Use the iframe SDK instance
  // index.ts
  import { iframeSdk } from "@/lib/iframe-sdk";

  const navigationButtonElement = document.querySelector("button");

  if (navigationButtonElement) {
    navigationButtonElement.addEventListener("click", () => {
      iframeSdk.openExternalUrl({ url: "https://example.com" });
    });
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

***

<Check>We have now setup the SDK and iFrame.</Check>


# Installation
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/installation

Getting started developing an App on Whop

We recommend you use our TS SDK to build your app. It's a wrapper around our GraphQL API. We have hand-crafted SDK functions that make it easy to use our API.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm install @whop/api && pnpm install -D @whop-apps/dev-proxy
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm install @whop/api && npm install -D @whop-apps/dev-proxy
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add @whop/api && yarn add -D @whop-apps/dev-proxy
  ```
</CodeGroup>

***


# Local development
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/local-development

Run your local setup inside of a Whop iFrame with the Whop proxy

If you are building a Whop app inside of our website, you can use this proxy to run your local setup inside of a Whop iFrame.
You can use this proxy with any application written in any language and any framework.

## NextJS / Javascript app

1. Add the proxy as a dev dependency.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add -D @whop-apps/dev-proxy
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm install -D @whop-apps/dev-proxy
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add -D @whop-apps/dev-proxy
  ```
</CodeGroup>

2. Update your `package.json` dev script to include the proxy.

```json
"scripts": {
	"dev": "whop-proxy --command 'next dev --turbopack'",
}
```

> You can update the dev command to match your framework requirements.
> You can also other commands wrapped by the proxy in a similar way.

3. Run the proxy.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm dev
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn dev
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Standalone mode (other frameworks)

1. Run you app on your local machine on some port, for example 5000.

2. Run the proxy in standalone mode.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm dlx @whop-apps/dev-proxy --standalone --upstreamPort=5000 --proxyPort=3000
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npx @whop-apps/dev-proxy --standalone --upstreamPort=5000 --proxyPort=3000
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn dlx @whop-apps/dev-proxy --standalone --upstreamPort=5000 --proxyPort=3000
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  This will run the proxy as an independent process. It will start a server on
  port 3000 and forward requests to port 5000 and append the user token in the
  headers.
</Note>

## Proxy Command Options

The proxy can be configured using the following command line options:

```bash
Usage: pnpm dlx @whop-apps/dev-proxy [options]

Options:

--proxyPort <port>      The port the proxy should listen on (3000 by default)
--upstreamPort <port>   The port the upstream server is listening on (set automatically by default)
--npmCommand <command>  The npm command to run to start the upstream server (dev by default)
--command <command>     The command to run to start the upstream server (npm run dev by default)
--standalone            Run the proxy as an independent process proxying requests from one port to another port. Ignores the command / npmCommand options.
```


# Retrieve current user
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/retrieve-current-user

Retrieve the public profile information for the currently logged in user

Verify and extract the user's ID from a JWT token passed in the `x-whop-user-token` header passed to iframe apps on your backend.

<Info>
  Ensure you have [setup your whop SDK client on the
  server](/sdk/whop-api-client)
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Next.js
  // app/experiences/[experienceId]/page.tsx

  import { whopSdk } from "@/lib/whop-sdk";
  import { headers } from "next/headers";

  export default async function Page() {
      const headersList = await headers(); // Get the headers from the request.

      // Extract the user ID (read from a verified auth JWT token)
      const { userId } = await whopSdk.verifyUserToken(headersList);

      // Load the user's public profile information
      const user = await whopSdk.users.getUser({ userId: userId });

      console.log(user);

      return (
        <div>
        	<h1>User</h1>
        	<pre>{JSON.stringify(user, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      );

  }

  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Not using the Whop TS SDK?

<Accordion title="How to authenticate users in other languages">
  In order to retrieve the current user's ID, you need to decrypt a JWT token that is stored in the `x-whop-user-token` header. `VerifyUserToken` is a helper function in our TS SDK that decodes the JWT token and returns the user's ID.

  If are using a different framework and do not have access to the Typescript Whop SDK, you will need to implement your own JWT decoding logic. Here is an example of how to do this in Ruby on Rails:

  ```ruby Ruby on Rails
  require 'jwt'
  require 'openssl'

  # This is a static public key that is used to decode the JWT token
  # You can put this into your application
  JWT_PEM = <<~PEM.freeze
    -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
    MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAErz8a8vxvexHC0TLT91g7llOdDOsN
    uYiGEfic4Qhni+HMfRBuUphOh7F3k8QgwZc9UlL0AHmyYqtbhL9NuJes6w==
    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
  PEM

  # In your request handler, extract the user token from the headers.
  user_token = request.headers["x-whop-user-token"]
  return if user_token.blank?

  # Decode and validate the JWT token.
  key = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new(JWT_PEM)
  payload, _header = JWT.decode user_token, key, true, {
    iss: "urn:whopcom:exp-proxy",
    verify_iss: true,
    algorithm: "ES256"
  }

  # Extract your app ID from the JWT token.
  jwt_app_id = payload["aud"]

  # WARNING! You must set the WHOP_APP_ID environment variable in your application.
  # This looks like app_xxxx.
  # Validate that the JWT token is for YOUR app. (prevents someone from spoofing the user ID by passing a JWT token for a different app)
  return if jwt_app_id != ENV.fetch("WHOP_APP_ID")

  # Extract the user ID from the JWT token.
  jwt_user_id = payload["sub"]
  ```
</Accordion>


# Validate access
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/validate-access

Use this API to ensure users have access to use your app

Validate access to an embedded web app:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Next.js
  import { whopSdk } from "@/lib/whop-sdk";
  import { headers } from "next/headers";

  // The headers contains the user token
  const headersList = await headers();

  // The experienceId is a path param
  // This can be configured in the Whop Dashboard, when you define your app
  const { experienceId } = await params;

  // The user token is in the headers
  const { userId } = await whopSdk.verifyUserToken(headersList);

  const result = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({
    userId,
    experienceId,
  });

  if (!result.hasAccess) {
    return <div>You do not have access to this experience</div>;
  }

  // Either: 'admin' | 'customer' | 'no_access';
  // 'admin' means the user is an admin of the whop, such as an owner or moderator
  // 'customer' means the user is a common member in this whop
  // 'no_access' means the user does not have access to the whop
  const { accessLevel } = result;

  if (accessLevel === "admin") {
    return <div>You are an admin of this experience</div>;
  }

  if (accessLevel === "customer") {
    return <div>You are a customer of this experience</div>;
  }

  return <div>You do not have access to this experience</div>;
  ```
</CodeGroup>


# Set up the API client
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/whop-api-client

We provide a TS client that makes it super easy to use our API. We highly recommend you use this client.

Our SDK makes it simple to use our API. It's a wrapper around our GraphQL API with pre-built functions for all of our endpoints. The endpoints are outlined in the SDK reference section of our docs.

### Install

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add @whop/api
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm install @whop/api
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add @whop/api
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Setup your client

Create a new file that instantiates the client and exports it. We recommend putting this file at `lib/whop-sdk.ts`.

This file reads your ENV keys, which can be found on your app developer page on the Whop dashboard.

```ts
import { WhopServerSdk, makeUserTokenVerifier } from "@whop/api";

export const whopSdk = WhopServerSdk({
  // This is the appId of your app. You can find this in the "App Settings" section of your app's Whop dashboard.
  // This is required.
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID,

  // Add your app api key here - this is required.
  // You can get this from the Whop dashboard after creating an app in the "API Keys" section.
  appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY,

  // This will make api requests on behalf of this user.
  // This is optional, however most api requests need to be made on behalf of a user.
  // You can create an agent user for your app, and use their userId here.
  // You can also apply a different userId later with the `withUser` function.
  onBehalfOfUserId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID,

  // This is the companyId that will be used for the api requests.
  // When making api requests that query or mutate data about a company, you need to specify the companyId.
  // This is optional, however if not specified certain requests will fail.
  // This can also be applied later with the `withCompany` function.
  companyId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID,
});
```

### Example usage

The rest of the examples in this section will use this client and import it from `lib/whop-sdk.ts`.

Here is an example

```ts
import { whopSdk } from "./lib/whop-sdk";

const user = await whopSdk.users.getCurrentUser();
```

## 1. Set up your Next.js project

Clone the Car Modification AI repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdullahZHD/car-modification-ai-whop
cd car-modification-ai-whop
```

Install dependencies:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm i
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm i
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn i
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 2. Get your Whop API credentials

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Whop App">
    1. Go to [https://whop.com/dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard)
    2. Navigate to **Developer**
    3. Click the **Create App** button
    4. Give your app a name like "Car Modification AI"
    5. Click **Create**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get your API Key, Agent User ID, and App ID">
    After creating your app:

    1. Copy the **App API Key** - you'll need this for `WHOP_API_KEY`
    2. Copy the **Agent User ID** - you'll need this for `WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID`
    3. Copy the **App ID** - you'll need this for `WHOP_APP_ID`

    <Note>
      The Agent User ID is what allows your app's agent to send post the results in forum.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 3. Get OpenAI API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create OpenAI Account">
    1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/)
    2. Click **Sign In** or **Sign Up**
    3. Complete the registration process
  </Step>

  <Step title="Get API Key">
    1. Go to **API Keys** in the dashboard
    2. Click **Create Key**
    3. Give it a name like **"Car Modification AI"**
    4. Copy the API key - you'll need this for `OPENAI_API_KEY` (ensure you have balance/payment method)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 5. Configure Environment Variables

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create local environment file">
    ```bash
    touch .env.local
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill in Required Variables">
    Open `.env` in your text editor and fill in these required fields:

    ```env
    # AI Service Configuration (Required)
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

    # Whop Integration (Required)
    WHOP_API_KEY=your_whop_api_key_here
    NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID=your_whop_agent_user_id_here
    NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=your_whop_app_id_here
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 7. Install Whop Dev Proxy

For Whop integration to work in development, you need to install the Whop dev proxy globally:

```bash
npm install @whop-apps/dev-proxy -g
```

<Note>
  The Whop dev proxy is required for the iframe integration to work properly
  during development.
</Note>

## 8. Run the Application

**Lets start the Web Server with Whop Proxy**.
Run this command to start both the Whop proxy and Next.js development server:

```bash
whop-proxy --command 'npx next dev --turbopack'
```

You should see output indicating both the proxy and Next.js are running. The web app will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

{" "}

<Warning>
  Do NOT use `npm run dev` alone - it won't include the Whop proxy and the
  iframe integration won't work!
</Warning>

## 9. Configure App Settings in Whop

**Important**: You must configure these settings BEFORE installing the app to your community.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Base URL and App Path">
    1. Go to your Whop app dashboard ‚Üí **Developer** ‚Üí Your App
    2. In the **Hosting** section, configure:
       * **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000/`
       * **App path**: `/experiences/[experienceId]`
    3. Click **Save** to update the settings

    <Warning>
      If you skip this step, the app installation and iframe integration won't work properly!
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 10. Accessing the app (locally)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the application via Whop iframe">
    1. After installing the app, click **Open Whop** in the top right 2. When
       redirected to Whop, click the **Settings** button 3. Change the dropdown
       from **Production** to **Localhost** 4. Choose your port (usually **3000**)
    2. You'll now see the app running in Localhost.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 11. Deploy to Vercel

Now let's deploy your car modification AI app to production so users can access it from anywhere.

**Push your code to GitHub**

First, commit all your changes and push to GitHub:

```bash
git add .

## Summary

This tutorial will guide you through building a ChatGPT-powered image generator using Next.js, Shadcn UI, and OpenAI.

View the final product [here](https://whop.com/apps/app_KHqcozSfEGNyhl/install/) by installing the app to your whop.

## 1. Set up your Next.js project

Clone our Next.js app template:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest ai-image-generator -e https://github.com/whopio/whop-nextjs-app-template
```

Enter the project directory:

```bash
cd ai-image-generator
```

Install dependencies:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm i
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm i
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn i
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Run the app locally:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm dev
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm run dev
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn dev
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Now open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and follow the directions on the page.

## 2. Start developing your app

After following the instructions on the page, you'll be able to start developing your app. You should have:

* Created your app
* Set up your `.env.local` file
* Installed your app into your whop

Ensure you're developing in `localhost` mode. See example:

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/whop/how-to-videos/change-to-localhost-mode.gif" alt="How to change to localhost mode" />
</Frame>

## 3. Set up your database

### Create a Supabase database

Go to [Supabase](https://supabase.com) and create a new account if you don't have one

Create a new project and copy your database password

### Set up Prisma

Now, let's set up Prisma in your project:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add prisma @prisma/client
  pnpm prisma init
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm install prisma @prisma/client
  npx prisma init
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add prisma @prisma/client
  yarn prisma init
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The `prisma init` command will create a new `prisma` directory with a `schema.prisma` file

Now, go copy your database connection strings from Supabase for Prisma to use. Then paste the values in your `.env.local` file.

Replace your password with `[YOUR-PASSWORD]`

<Frame>
  <img src="https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/whop/how-to-videos/prisma-setup.gif" alt="How to setup Prisma with Supabase" />
</Frame>

Replace the contents of `prisma/schema.prisma` with:

```prisma prisma/schema.prisma
// This is your Prisma schema file,
// learn more about it in the docs: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider  = "postgresql"
  url       = env("DATABASE_URL")
  directUrl = env("DIRECT_URL")
}

model Experience {
  id           String @unique
  prompt       String
}
```

Now generate your database and Prisma client:

> These are custom scripts we defined in the package.json file to load your env from .env.local and run the prisma commands. If you want to use the native prisma CLI, you'll need to move your `.env.local` to `.env` and run the commands manually.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm prisma:generate
  pnpm prisma:db:push
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm run prisma:generate
  npm run prisma:db push
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn prisma:generate
  yarn prisma:db:push
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## 4. Install additional dependencies

### Add the required packages

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add openai sharp react-dropzone @radix-ui/react-slot gsap
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm install openai sharp react-dropzone @radix-ui/react-slot gsap
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add openai sharp react-dropzone @radix-ui/react-slot gsap
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Install a Shadcn button

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npx shadcn@latest add button
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn shadcn@latest add button
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Add your OpenAI API key

Add to your `.env.local`:

```env .env.local
# OpenAI API Key for image generation
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## 5. Create components

### `<ImageUploader>`

This component handles image upload and generation.

```typescript app/components/image-uploader.tsx [expandable]
"use client";

import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import gsap from "gsap";
import { DrawSVGPlugin } from "gsap/DrawSVGPlugin";
import Image from "next/image";
import { useCallback, useEffect, useRef, useState } from "react";
import { useDropzone } from "react-dropzone";

gsap.registerPlugin(DrawSVGPlugin);

function Loader() {
  const svgRef = useRef<SVGSVGElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!svgRef.current) return;

    const mid = gsap.utils.toArray("#mid *").reverse();

    const fatTl = gsap.timeline();
    fatTl.fromTo(
      "#fat *",
      {
        drawSVG: "0% 20%",
      },
      {
        drawSVG: "40% 69%",
        stagger: {
          each: 0.05,
          repeat: -1,
          yoyo: true,
        },
        duration: 0.75,
        ease: "sine.inOut",
      }
    );

    const midTl = gsap.timeline();
    midTl.fromTo(
      mid,
      {
        drawSVG: "0% 20%",
      },
      {
        drawSVG: "56% 86%",
        stagger: {
          each: 0.08,
          repeat: -1,
          yoyo: true,
        },
        duration: 0.81,
        ease: "sine.inOut",
      }
    );

    const thinTl = gsap.timeline();
    thinTl.fromTo(
      "#thin *",
      {
        drawSVG: "20% 51%",
      },
      {
        drawSVG: "40% 80%",
        stagger: {
          each: 0.092,
          repeat: -1,
          yoyo: true,
        },
        duration: 1.4,
        ease: "sine.inOut",
      }
    );

    const mainTl = gsap.timeline();
    mainTl.add([fatTl, midTl, thinTl], 0);

    return () => {
      mainTl.kill();
    };
  }, []);

  let experience = await prisma.experience.findUnique({
    where: { id: experienceId },
  });

  if (!experience) {
    experience = await prisma.experience.create({
      data: {
        id: experienceId,
        prompt: "",
      },
    });
  }

  return experience;
}

export default async function ExperiencePage({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ experienceId: string }>;
}) {
  const headersList = await headers();
  const { userId } = await whopSdk.verifyUserToken(headersList);

  const { experienceId } = await params;
  const experience = await findOrCreateExperience(experienceId);

  const hasAccess = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({
    userId,
    experienceId,
  });

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 p-4 h-screen items-center justify-center">
      <ExperiencePrompt
        prompt={experience.prompt}
        accessLevel={hasAccess.accessLevel}
        experienceId={experienceId}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### `app/experiences/[experienceId]/edit/page.tsx`

This page allows admins to edit the experience prompt.

```typescript app/experiences/[experienceId]/edit/page.tsx [expandable]
import EditExperiencePrompt from "@/components/edit-experience-prompt";

export default async function Page({
  params,
}: {
  params: Promise<{ experienceId: string }>;
}) {
  const { experienceId } = await params;
  return <EditExperiencePrompt experienceId={experienceId} />;
}
```

## 7. Create the API routes

### `app/api/experiences/[experienceId]/generate/route.ts`

This API route generates images using OpenAI's DALL-E API.

```typescript app/api/experiences/[experienceId]/generate/route.ts [expandable]
import { whopSdk } from "@/lib/whop-sdk";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import OpenAI from "openai";
import sharp from "sharp";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

export async function POST(
  request: Request,
  { params }: { params: Promise<{ experienceId: string }> }
) {
  try {
    const { experienceId } = await params;

    if (!experienceId) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Missing experienceId" },
        { status: 400 }
      );
    }

    const headersList = await headers();
    const userToken = await whopSdk.verifyUserToken(headersList);
    if (!userToken) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
    }

    const hasAccess = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({
      userId: userToken.userId,
      experienceId,
    });

    if (!hasAccess.hasAccess) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Unauthorized, no access" },
        { status: 401 }
      );
    }

    const [publicUser, experience] = await Promise.all([
      whopSdk.users.getUser({
        userId: userToken.userId,
      }),
      prisma.experience.findUnique({
        where: {
          id: experienceId,
        },
      }),
    ]);

    if (!request.body || !experience?.prompt) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Image and prompt are required" },
        { status: 400 }
      );
    }

    const originalFile = new File(
      [
        await sharp(await request.clone().arrayBuffer())
          .png()
          .toBuffer(),
      ],
      `${Date.now()}-original.png`,
      {
        type: "image/png",
      }
    );

    // Generate image using DALL-E with prompt
    const response = await openai.images.edit({
      model: "gpt-image-1",
      image: originalFile,
      prompt: experience.prompt,
      n: 1,
      size: "auto",
      quality: "low",
    });

    console.log("Response:", response);

    // Get the base64 image data from the response
    const base64Image = response.data?.[0]?.b64_json;
    if (!base64Image) {
      throw new Error("No image data returned from OpenAI");
    }
    const generatedImageBuffer = Buffer.from(base64Image, "base64");

    const generationId = crypto.randomUUID();

    const [originalFileUploadResponse, uploadResponse] = await Promise.all([
      whopSdk.attachments.uploadAttachment({
        file: originalFile,
        record: "forum_post",
      }),
      whopSdk.attachments.uploadAttachment({
        file: new File(
          [generatedImageBuffer],
          `${generationId}-generated.png`,
          {
            type: "image/png",
          }
        ),
        record: "forum_post",
      }),
    ]);

    const whopExperience = await whopSdk.experiences.getExperience({
      experienceId,
    });
    const companyId = whopExperience.experience.company.id;

    const generatedAttachmentId = uploadResponse.directUploadId;
    const originalAttachmentId = originalFileUploadResponse.directUploadId;

    const forum = await whopSdk.forums.findOrCreateForum({
      experienceId: experience.id,
      name: "AI Uploads",
    });

    const forumId = forum.createForum?.id;

    const post = await whopSdk.forums.createForumPost({
      forumExperienceId: forumId,
      content: `@${publicUser.publicUser?.username} generated this image with the prompt: "${experience.prompt}"\n\nTry it yourself here: https://whop.com/hub/${companyId}/${experience.id}/app\n\nBefore vs After ‚¨áÔ∏è`,
      attachments: [
        { directUploadId: originalAttachmentId },
        { directUploadId: generatedAttachmentId },
      ],
    });

    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      imageUrl: uploadResponse.attachment.source.url,
      postId: post?.id,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error generating image:", error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Failed to generate image" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

### `app/api/experiences/[experienceId]/route.ts`

This API route is a PUT operation to an experience in the database.

```typescript app/api/experiences/[experienceId]/route.ts [expandable]
import { whopSdk } from "@/lib/whop-sdk";
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";
import { prisma } from "@/lib/db";

export async function PUT(request: Request) {
  try {
    const { prompt } = await request.json();
    const headersList = await headers();
    const userToken = await whopSdk.verifyUserToken(headersList);
    if (!userToken) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
    }
    const url = new URL(request.url);
    const match = url.pathname.match(/experiences\/([^/]+)/);
    const experienceId = match ? match[1] : null;

    if (!experienceId) {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Missing experienceId" },
        { status: 400 }
      );
    }

    const hasAccess = await whopSdk.access.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({
      userId: userToken.userId,
      experienceId,
    });
    if (hasAccess.accessLevel !== "admin") {
      return NextResponse.json(
        { error: "Unauthorized, not admin" },
        { status: 401 }
      );
    }

    const updatedExperience = await prisma.experience.update({
      where: {
        id: experienceId,
      },
      data: {
        prompt,
      },
    });

    await whopSdk.notifications.sendNotification({
      content: prompt,
      experienceId,
      title: "Prompt updated ‚ú®",
    });

    return NextResponse.json(updatedExperience);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error updating experience:", error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Failed to update experience" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

## 8. Deploy to Vercel

1. Add this script to the `scripts` section of your `package.json` to generate the Prisma client:

```json package.json
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "prisma generate"
  }
```

2. Push your code to GitHub
3. Create a new project on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Add all environment variables
6. Deploy and copy your Vercel URL
7. Update your Whop app settings with the new URL in the "Base URL" field

> Vercel functions automatically timeout after 60 seconds on a hobby account. Images might take longer than 60 seconds. This will cause errors. You can upgrade to a paid account to avoid this or swap out the image generator to a different API.

Your AI image generation app is now ready! Users can upload images, apply AI transformations based on prompts, and share their creations in the community forum.

# React Native (Beta)
Source: https://dev.whop.com/tutorials/react-native

Build whop apps using React Native for fast, mobile optimized experiences.

<Info>
  The react native sdks are still in beta and we're actively working to improve
  and fix any bugs. Currently the [whop
  courses](https://whop.com/apps/app_0vPZThfBpAwLo/) app is fully powered by
  react native on both iOS and Android.
</Info>

# Getting started

Create a new app in the [dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer) and copy environment variables from the app details page.

### Create the app locally

Ensure you have at least node 22+ installed and pnpm 9.15+.
To check run `node -v` and `pnpm -v`.

```bash
pnpm create @whop/react-native@latest
```

This creates a new whop react native skeleton app. `cd` into your new folder (named after your provided app name) and install dependencies using pnpm.

```bash
cd my-app
pnpm install
```

### Edit your code

The entry point for your app is in `src/views/experience-view.tsx`.
This view will be rendered when a creator installs your app into their whop.

For example, you can render a button that will greet the current user id.

```tsx
import type { ExperienceViewProps } from "@whop/react-native";
import { Button, Alert, View } from "react-native";

export function ExperienceView(props: ExperienceViewProps) {
  function handleGreet() {
    Alert.alert(
      `Hello ${props.currentUserId}! Welcome to experience ${props.experienceId}`
    );
  }

  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: "center", alignItems: "center" }}>
      <Button title="Click Me!" onPress={handleGreet} />
    </View>
  );
}
```

### Install your app

Install your new app into your whop so you can preview it on your phone.

```bash
pnpm whop-react-native install
```

Open the app from inside your whop on your iPhone and shake it.
This enables "dev mode" and allows you to see the latest 'non production' react native builds.
On android you can use the info button in the top right to toggle developer mode.

Right now, it should show an error in the bottom saying "No build found ..."

<Info>
  Developer mode can only be activated by owners and admins of the company that
  owns the app.
</Info>

### Ship it!

```bash
pnpm ship
```

The `ship` command will build and upload your app to the whop servers. You can
limit the platforms by passing either `--ios` or `--android`. From here it
will be pushed live to your phone.

<Info>
  The `ship` command will NOT push the app to existing users of your app. It is
  safe to run on existing web apps too meaning you can progressively migrate
  your app to react native.
</Info>

### Deploy to production.

Once you're happy with your app go to your [developer dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer) and click "Promote to production" on your latest development build.

After going through an automated review, the app will be pushed instantly to all users of your app on iOS and Android.

<Info>
  ProTip: the `pnpm ship` command prints out a link you can use to promote your
  app to production.
</Info>

From the builds screen you can also instant rollback to a previous production build which will be pushed live to all users across whop.

# Native Integration

The beauty of react native is its rich integration with native platform features and APIs.

The Whop app exposes a set of common powerful native building blocks your can directly use in your react native app.

Features like video playback, camera access, native gestures and animations are available already.
We plan on expanding the capabilities to allow many different kinds of apps to be built!

You can use these libraries pinned to these version:

* `react-native-nitro-modules@0.26.3`
* `react-native-video@6.16.1`
* `@d11/react-native-fast-image@8.10.0`
* `react-native-svg@15.12.0`
* `react-native-webview@13.15.0`
* `react-native-reanimated@3.18.0`
* `react-native-gesture-handler@2.27.2`
* `react-native-haptic-feedback@2.3.3`
* `react-native-vision-camera@4.7.1`
* `react-native-safe-area-context@5.5.2`

# Whop SDK

The whop sdk is available for use in the react native app out of the box. Using this you can fetch data within the scope of the current user.

<Info>
  We recommend using the `useQuery` hook from `@tanstack/react-query` to fetch
  data.
</Info>

```tsx
import { whopSdk } from "@whop/react-native";

export function MyComponent() {
  const { data: user } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["user"],
    queryFn: () => whopSdk.users.getCurrentUser(),
  });

  return <Text>{user?.name}</Text>;
}
```

# Future plans

* Filesystem access
* Whop UI Kit
* Integrated router + robust deeplinking support
* More native modules
* Web Support + Hosting!

# Making authenticated requests

You can make authenticated requests to your api by using the same proxy infrastructure used for existing web apps.

1. Set your api origin as the `Base Domain` in the [developer dashboard](https://whop.com/dashboard/developer)
2. Make a normal fetch request from your react native app using the `apiOrigin` from `__internal_execSync("getAppApiOrigin", {})`

```tsx
const apiOrigin = __internal_execSync("getAppApiOrigin", {});

// Assuming your server has this api endpoint:
fetch(`${apiOrigin}/api/v1/users/me`).then((res) => res.json());
```

3. On your server use the standard `verifyUserToken` function from the SDK to verify the request. Auth between react native apps and whop iframe apps is exactly the same meaning you can *reuse* your backend.

# Color themes

React native by default exposes a `useColorScheme` hook that you can use to get the current color scheme of the device. This works correctly out of the box on whop react native apps too!.

While we are still building our UI kit, you can use the following `useColors` hook as inspiration to build your own dynamic color scheme:

```bash
# Install the radix ui colors package
pnpm i @radix-ui/colors
```

```tsx Usage
function MyComponent() {
  const colors = useColors();

  return <View style={{ backgroundColor: colors.gray1 }} />;
}
```

Hook implementation to copy:

```tsx use-colors.ts expandable
import {
  amber,
  amberA,
  amberDark,
  amberDarkA,
  blue,
  blueA,
  blueDark,
  blueDarkA,
  gray,
  grayA,
  grayDark,
  grayDarkA,
  green,
  greenA,
  greenDark,
  greenDarkA,
  red,
  redA,
  redDark,
  redDarkA,
} from "@radix-ui/colors";
import { useColorScheme } from "react-native";

export function useColors() {
  const colorScheme = useColorScheme();
  const isDark = colorScheme === "dark";

  // Create all the color groups
  const _grayA = isDark ? grayDarkA : grayA;
  const _gray = isDark ? grayDark : gray;
  const _blueA = isDark ? blueDarkA : blueA;
  const _blue = isDark ? blueDark : blue;
  const _redA = isDark ? redDarkA : redA;
  const _red = isDark ? redDark : red;
  const _amberA = isDark ? amberDarkA : amberA;
  const _amber = isDark ? amberDark : amber;
  const _greenA = isDark ? greenDarkA : greenA;
  const _green = isDark ? greenDark : green;

  // Merge them
  return {
    transparent: "transparent" as const,
    ..._grayA,
    ..._gray,
    ..._blueA,
    ..._blue,
    ..._redA,
    ..._red,
    ..._amberA,
    ..._amber,
    ..._greenA,
    ..._green,
  };
}
```

# Secret internal features

We are still working on polishing our api's but if you wanna build something cool RIGHT NOW, you can use some internal api's to communicate with the whop app.

<Warning>
  These function may throw. Use within a `try {} catch (e) {}` block.
</Warning>

```tsx
import { __internal_execSync, __internal_execAsync } from "@whop/react-native";

// Example usage:
__internal_execSync("routerPush", {
  path: ["some", "second", "page"],
  params: { query: "hello" },
});
// Pro tip: the `path` and `query` is passed as a prop to the `ExperienceView`
// component. This is how multi level routing works for courses currently.

// Full list of calls and types available here:

export interface PathParams {
  path: string[];
  params: Record<string, string>;
}

export interface ExecSyncApi {
  getAppApiOrigin(params: EmptyObject): { apiOrigin: string };
  cacheGet(params: { key?: string | null }): { data?: string | null };
  cacheSet(params: { key?: string | null; data?: string | null }): EmptyObject;
  routerPush(params: PathParams): EmptyObject;
  routerPop(params: EmptyObject): EmptyObject;
  routerGetCurrent(params: EmptyObject): PathParams;
  setNavigationBarData(params: {
    title?: string | null;
    description?: string | null;
  }): EmptyObject;
  routerPresentSheet(params: PathParams): EmptyObject;
  routerDismissSheet(params: EmptyObject): EmptyObject;
  routerGetCurrentSheet(params: EmptyObject): PathParams | null | undefined;
  downgradeToWebView(params: EmptyObject): EmptyObject;
  getHostAppDetails(params: EmptyObject): {
    build: string;
    version: string;
    platform: "ios" | "android" | "web";
    buildType: "appstore" | "testflight" | "debug";
  };
}

export interface ExecAsyncApi extends ExecSyncApi {
  inAppPurchase(params: { id?: string | null; planId: string }): {
    sessionId: string;
    receiptId: string;
  };
}
```
